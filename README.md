# Project Dreams: A Deckbuilding Therapy Session [v0.10](CHANGELOG.md)


[![Project Dreams preview image](http://dreams.dbzer0.com/dreams_showcase.gif "Project Dreams preview image")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc1_G28q328)

Dreams is a 'spire-like' deckbuilder card game where you take the part of a dreamer captured in a nightmare realm in their recurring dreams and struggling to overcome their own issues to break out of this loop.

This an early release and the balance will be off. A very basic skeleton of encounters and a boss have been added, so it should be possible to make a complete run with what is there.

Feel free to download and try. Tutorial is forthcoming.
You can also [play it online](http://dreams.dbzer0.com/)

## Story

*You realize you're dreaming. This is nothing like what you're used to in your dreams though. It feels more solid, and it seems like you have more agency, but this feels more like a nightmare. The things going on in your life must have affected you harder than you think...*

In every game you start, you represent someone who has been captured in the pull of the nightmare realm due to some great injustice they have enountered (or done) in their waking life. Even worse, the elements of your injustice are bleeding into your dreams. The only way out is to interpret them and make a breakthrough in yourself.

# Basic Gameplay

Your Dreamer represents the character guiding to have a breakthrough. Before you start the game, you choose the aspects of their personality, which will affect how they interact with the nightmare realm. 
As with all dreams, the manifestations of these aspects tend towards the surreal.

As part of your quest for your personal breakthrough, you will be enountering enemies (called "Torments") which are a mental manifestation of the things that caused your dreamer to be having these nightmares in the first place.

You short objective when facing a torment is to "interpret" it and therefore help you find meaning in your dreams. On the other hand, the torments you're facing will be causing you stress, as aspects of your real life problems are bleeding into your dreams. Accumulate enough Anxiety, and your dreamer will wake up in cold-sweats, and you'll have failed that run.

The game follows the typical gameplay of a deckbuilder. You draw 5 cards per turn, and you use them to deal with the current situation. Any cards you didn't use will be discarded, and you'll draw 5 new ones at the end of your turn. You will also have the capacity to draft new cards whenever you complete an Toroments encounter. 

## Basic Terminology

* Dreamer: The character you're playing as.
* Torment: The enemies you're facing in your dreams. Manifestations of your anxieties and problems.
* Interpret: The act of defeating the Torments. If a Torment's Interpretation reaches its max, it will be overcome. Overcome all of them to progress to the next encounter.
* Anxiety/Stress: Interacting with your deeper fears is never a pleasant thing. The Torments you're facing will regularly be inducing stress to you, raising your Anxiety. If your Anxiety ever reaches the max amount, you will wake up from the dreams without achieving your breakthrough

Most other terms you'll encounter will be explained when mousing over cards or icons.
