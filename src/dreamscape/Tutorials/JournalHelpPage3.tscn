Not only that but the further that pathos is repressed, by the dreamer avoiding it, the stronger its effects when they finally choose it.

As soon as the dreamer chooses an encounter matching a certain pathos,a portion of it is released. Released pathos can be spent in the shop.

What encounter each repressed pathos is likely to bring, is something better discovered on your own."
